# Cloud Mavis cron: stock-screener-focus-rvol-09:45 (cron #07) — repaired 2026-10-24

You are running as a Cloud Mavis cron on Mavis. Linux sandbox: no PowerShell, no Windows paths.
Output root: /workspace/ (mkdir -p it if missing).

## CONVERSATION TITLE (do this FIRST, before anything else)

Every scheduled run gets its own conversation — one conversation per fire, never appended to an
earlier run's conversation. Give this conversation a title that says which day this run belongs
to, so the conversation list stays scannable.

1. Resolve today's date in US/Eastern: `TZ=America/New_York date +%d-%m` (day-month, no year).
2. Build the title: `[<DD-MM>] <NN>-<routine name>`. Take `<NN>` and `<routine name>` from the
   first line of this prompt (`# Cloud Mavis cron: <routine name> (cron #NN)`).
   Example: `[31-10] 12-cross-asset-correlation-snapshot`.
3. Set it with one call: `mcp_invoke` with tool_name `session_update` and arguments
   `{"session_id": "me", "title": "<the title>"}`. `me` means THIS conversation.
   If `mcp_invoke` reports that the tool is unknown, call `tool_search` with the query
   "session title update", then retry the same `mcp_invoke` call.
4. If the title cannot be set for any reason, carry on with the routine. This step must never
   block, delay, or fail the artifact.

## SCHEDULE
Deployed schedule: `45 9 * * 1-5` America/New_York — 09:45 ET, Mon-Fri only.
- The day-of-week field is set in the SCHEDULER, so this routine does not fire
  at all on weekends: no agent invocation is spent discovering it is a weekend,
  and no weekend SKIPPED file is written. The in-prompt weekend branch below is
  kept as a belt-and-braces guard (it costs one line) and is what still handles
  US market holidays, which no cron expression can express.
The timezone was Etc/GMT-7 (= UTC+7) on the local machine, which fired this 11h off and
after market close; it is now America/New_York, so live intraday bars exist. Do not skip a run
because you think the market is closed — check the clock.

## WINDOW CHECK (RUN FIRST, BEFORE FETCHING THE SKILL)

The scheduler owns the day-of-week and the hour, so this block exists for ONE reason: a cron
expression cannot express a **market holiday**, and the scheduler fires Mon-Fri *including* them.
On a holiday the market is closed and there is nothing to report.

```bash
# US MARKET HOLIDAYS — 2026 NYSE closures (non-weekend):
#   2026-01-01 2026-01-19 2026-02-16 2026-04-03 2026-05-25 2026-06-19 2026-07-03
#   2026-09-07 2026-11-26 2026-12-25
# Half-days (07:00 13:00 ET) are trading days and still report — do NOT skip them.
# The date is the fire's SCHEDULED date, not the execution date. If this is a
# delayed replay (the platform re-dispatches a session whose quota was exhausted),
# rebuild for the scheduled date and say so in the artifact - do not skip.
DATE=$(TZ=America/New_York date +%Y-%m-%d)
case "$DATE" in
    2026-01-01|2026-01-19|2026-02-16|2026-04-03|2026-05-25|2026-06-19|2026-07-03|2026-09-07|2026-11-26|2026-12-25)
        mkdir -p /workspace/$DATE
        cat > /workspace/$DATE/SKIPPED_stock_screener_focus_rvol_09_45.md <<EOF
# Cron #07 stock_screener_focus_rvol_09_45 — SKIPPED
- Date (ET): $DATE
- Time (ET): $(TZ=America/New_York date +%H:%M)
- Reason: US market holiday ($DATE)
- No artifact produced.
EOF
        echo "out-of-window: US market holiday ($DATE)"
        echo "no artifact; no push"
        exit 0
        ;;
esac
echo "window-check: OK ($DATE)"
```

## STEP 2 — SKILL SPEC (fetch once)
curl -sS -w 'HTTP=%{http_code}\n' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/skills/stock-screener-suite/SKILL.md -o /tmp/skill.md
If that fails, retry once with -k (the GitHub cert has expired intermittently). Read the file in full
and follow the procedure with the Cloud adaptations below. If both attempts fail: write a stub
artifact with _source: skill_fetch_failed, report errors: 1, stop. Never improvise from memory.

## STEP 3 — SYNC UPSTREAM OUTPUTS (this was the blocking bug)
The upstream daily-sweep cron (#9, task 446554052374600) runs 18:30 ET and writes the Focus list to
the karizaco/minimax-cloud-outputs git remote. This cron sandbox does NOT share a filesystem with
it. You MUST pull before looking for the focus list:
cd /workspace
git init -q 2>/dev/null || true
git remote remove origin 2>/dev/null || true
git remote add origin https://x-access-token:${GITHUB_TOKEN}@github.com/karizaco/minimax-cloud-outputs.git 2>/dev/null || true
git config user.email maxhermes-cloud@local
git config user.name 'MaxHermes Cloud Cron'
GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true git fetch -q origin main 2>&1 | head -3
git checkout origin/main -- daily-screens 2>/dev/null || true
If GITHUB_TOKEN is unset, skip the sync and record upstream: unavailable (no token). Do NOT fabricate
a focus list.

## STEP 4 — LOCATE THE FOCUS LIST
DATE=$(TZ=America/New_York date +%Y-%m-%d)
YDAY=$(TZ=America/New_York date -d yesterday +%Y-%m-%d)
for d in /workspace/daily-screens/$DATE /workspace/daily-screens/$YDAY; do
  if [ -f $d/focus.md ]; then echo FOUND $d/focus.md; fi
done
ls -1t /workspace/daily-screens/*/focus.md 2>/dev/null | head -3
Also check master.md in the same dirs for the wider universe.
If no focus.md exists the run FAILED, it is not 'degraded but fine'. Write the artifact with
status: failed_no_upstream_focus_list, upstream: missing, list what you did find under
daily-screens/, report errors: 1, and stop. Do not push an empty snapshot as if it were a screen.
If a focus.md is found, report its path AND the data-date in its header. The sweep data date can lag
the fire date; that lag must appear in your artifact header.

## STEP 5 — RVOL PER FOCUS TICKER
Do NOT use mcp__tradingview_advanced__*, mcp__tradingview__* or mcp__yahoo_finance__*. They are
provably absent in Cloud sessions: mcode-tools connector tools returns partial=false,
provider_failures=[], with only connector__matrix__* and connector__email_workbench_credentials__*,
and tool_search returns 0 hits for every finance keyword. Do not burn turns re-testing them.

Working path, in order:
1. Intraday RVOL (preferred, matches the skill step 7): Yahoo chart API, ONE symbol per call:
   https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/SYMBOL?interval=5m&range=1d
   RVOL = cumulative volume today / average daily volume over 10 days. Take the denominator from the
   TV scanner column average_volume_10d_calc. Yahoo does NOT accept comma-separated symbols (404)
   and rate-limits (429) under load: sleep 1s between calls, retry once on 429.
2. Fallback, daily relative volume proxy: TradingView public scanner
   POST https://scanner.tradingview.com/america/scan with verified TLS, column
   relative_volume_10d_calc. If you use this, label the metric rvol_proxy_daily in the artifact.
   It is NOT intraday RVOL and the artifact must say so.

Record the data timestamp for every symbol from the payload. A symbol with no intraday bars yet gets
no_intraday_bars - never silently substitute a daily value. ETFs and overnight-traded symbols can
carry an in-progress bar: drop bars dated after the session date and note that you did.

## STEP 6 — BUCKETS AND ALERT
Sort focus tickers by RVOL desc. RVOL Required = RVOL >= 3. Liquid = the rest.
If any ticker crossed from below 1 to above 3, emit one chat alert naming it.
An empty bucket is a real result. Report it as an empty bucket with counts, not as a failure.

## STEP 7 — WRITE THE ARTIFACT
Write /workspace/daily-screens/DATE/focus-rvol-snapshot.md (create the dir; DATE = today ET).
Front-matter: date, cron, fire_time_et, data_date, source, method, status, upstream focus.md path.
Then a table: symbol | close | RVOL | bucket | data timestamp.
Then counts, the method actually used, and any degradation.
status must be exactly one of: ok, degraded_daily_rvol_proxy, failed_no_upstream_focus_list,
failed_no_data.

## RUNTIME DATA-SOURCE CONTRACT (read before fetching any data)

**The `mcp__*` tools named above DO NOT EXIST in this runtime.** Do not attempt an MCP call and do
not wait for one to appear — a tool-not-found error converts into an early abort with no artifact.
Use instead: `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `bash` (curl, python3), and `connector__github__*` for repo
writes.

**Source ladder — try in this order, fall through on a real failure:**

1. bridge `market-recap` → `get_quotes` (batch quotes, `previous_close`, `change_pct`, `volume`,
   `as_of`, `market_state`). Not rate-limited. **This is the quote source of record.**
2. TradingView scanner `POST https://scanner.tradingview.com/america/scan` — movers, RVol,
   `premarket_volume`, `halted`, `market_cap_basic`.
3. Yahoo JSON — **availability varies by egress** (429 from one cron session, 200 from another on
   the same day). Try it; on 429/401 fall through. `quoteSummary`/`options` need the crumb.
4. Nasdaq API, SEC EDGAR (needs a contact-style User-Agent), CoinGecko, Frankfurter, Treasury CSV.

**A 429/403 is a RATE LIMIT, not a missing symbol.** Never report "no data" for a symbol you never
successfully queried. Retry once after a short sleep, then fall through.

**Sanity-check the RESPONSE BODY, not just the HTTP status.** Stooq returns 200 with a JavaScript
challenge, not CSV.

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/_shared/RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md`


### MCP AVAILABILITY PROBE (non-blocking, one cheap call)

```bash
B=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/_shared
[ -s /workspace/probe_mcp.py ] || curl -sL -o /workspace/probe_mcp.py "$B/probe_mcp.py"
python3 /workspace/probe_mcp.py
```

Record the result in this run's `## Source health`. It prints exactly one of:
- `catalog_ok total=N finance_tools=0` — catalog healthy, no financial MCP registered.
- `catalog_ok total=N finance_tools=K` — **a financial MCP has LANDED. Switch to it this run.**
- `catalog_unreachable` — the probe failed. **NOT** evidence that no MCPs exist.
- `probe_unavailable` — the probe binary is absent. **NOT a finding**; use the source ladder.


### PRIMARY SOURCE: the MCP-over-HTTP bridge (use this FIRST)

The `mcp__*` tool names above are NOT registered here, but the MCP SERVERS are reachable
over plain HTTPS JSON-RPC from the sandbox. A ready-made bridge is published with the set:

  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/_shared/mcp_bridge.py

```bash
BR=/workspace/mcp_bridge.py
for U in \

  [ -s "$BR" ] || curl -sL -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.raw" -o "$BR" "$U" 2>/dev/null
done
[ -s "$BR" ] || echo "bridge fetch FAILED - fall back to web_search, then the curl ladder"

python3 /workspace/barchart_fetch.py --list top-gainers --limit 20
```

**Verified 2026-10-28:** both servers answer, 6/6 identical values over 6 calls (median 204 ms),
returning the same close web_search gave (SPY 769.66, 2026-10-27) while Yahoo JSON was 429.
Fetch the bridge with the 3-URL ladder above - a freshly pushed file can 404 on the raw CDN
for a few minutes. The bridge returns `{"error": ...}` and a non-zero exit on failure, so a
failed call can never be mistaken for data. **Pass tool args as a FILE, not inline** - shell
quoting corrupts the JSON. Server/tool reference: the RUNTIME-CONTRACT.md URL above.

**Order of attack: MCP bridge -> `web_search` -> curl ladder.** The bridge is the richest
source and is not rate-limited, so try it before Yahoo. If it fails, fall through.

### Rules

1. **A 429/403 is a RATE LIMIT, not a missing symbol.** Never report "no data" for a symbol you
   never successfully queried. Retry once after a short sleep, then fall through the ladder.
2. **Sanity-check the RESPONSE BODY, not just the HTTP status.** The proxy can return HTTP 200
   carrying a plain-text error page. Confirm the body parses as the JSON/CSV you expect.
3. **Never fabricate a number.** If every source for a symbol failed, omit that symbol and say so.
   A missing row is recoverable; an invented price is not.
4. **Distinguish "no data" from "no source".** No print today (pre-market, weekend, holiday) is
   `no_data`. A symbol you could not fetch is `fetch_failed` — name the reason and HTTP status.
5. **Every artifact carries a `## Source health` section**: per source, the URL/query used, the
   HTTP status, and `ok` / `failed:<reason>`. If a source was rate-limited, say `429 rate-limited`
   and which fallback you used. Never hide a degraded run.
6. **Partial data beats no data.** If some symbols resolved and others did not, WRITE the
   artifact with the symbols you have, mark the gaps, and report `errors: <n>`. Do not abort the
   whole run because one source was blocked. The zero-fallback policy governs the *fallback
   chain*, not whether the artifact gets written.
7. **One number per field, one source per field.** When two sources give different
   values for the same field, pick ONE and say which in `## Source health`: the bridge's
   `market-recap` for prices and movers (it is Yahoo-sourced and not rate-limited), the TradingView
   scanner for pre-market and RVol, Yahoo JSON for history. When they disagree by more than 0.6 %,
   prefer the bridge, say so, and **do not publish both**. Never report "no source available" when
   a source is reachable — a 429 is a rate limit, not an absence.


## GIT PUSH (OPTIONAL)

```bash
B=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/_shared
for U in "$B/push_artifact.sh" "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/karizaco/maxhermes-migration@main/cloud-prompts/_shared/push_artifact.sh"; do
  [ -s /workspace/push_artifact.sh ] || curl -sL -o /workspace/push_artifact.sh "$U"
done
sh /workspace/push_artifact.sh --out daily-screens --add daily-screens/{date}/focus-rvol-snapshot.md --branch main
sh /workspace/verify_delivery.sh --path daily-screens/{date}/focus-rvol-snapshot.md --branch main
```

**If the push script cannot be fetched**, use the inline fallback in
`cloud-prompts/_shared/push_artifact.sh` — but never `git add -A`, and never
`git push … | head -3` (that returns head's exit status and reports a rejected push as success).


## DELIVERY VERIFICATION (MANDATORY - do this after the push block)

```bash
B=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/_shared
for U in "$B/push_artifact.sh" "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/karizaco/maxhermes-migration@main/cloud-prompts/_shared/push_artifact.sh"; do
  [ -s /workspace/push_artifact.sh ] || curl -sL -o /workspace/push_artifact.sh "$U"
done
sh /workspace/push_artifact.sh --out daily-screens --add daily-screens/{date}/focus-rvol-snapshot.md --branch main
sh /workspace/verify_delivery.sh --path daily-screens/{date}/focus-rvol-snapshot.md --branch main
```

**If the push script cannot be fetched**, use the inline fallback in
`cloud-prompts/_shared/push_artifact.sh` — but never `git add -A`, and never
`git push … | head -3` (that returns head's exit status and reports a rejected push as success).
