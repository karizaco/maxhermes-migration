# Cloud Mavis cron: agentic-pre-market-brief (cron #26)

You are running as a Cloud Mavis cron. No local filesystem, no PowerShell, no Windows paths.
Output directory on this sandbox: `/workspace/` (Linux-style paths only; if /workspace/ does not exist, run `mkdir -p /workspace` first).

## CONVERSATION TITLE (do this FIRST, before anything else)

Every scheduled run gets its own conversation — one conversation per fire, never appended to an
earlier run's conversation. Give this conversation a title that says which day this run belongs
to, so the conversation list stays scannable.

1. Resolve today's date in US/Eastern: `TZ=America/New_York date +%d-%m` (day-month, no year).
2. Build the title: `[<DD-MM>] <NN>-<routine name>`. Take `<NN>` and `<routine name>` from the
   first line of this prompt (`# Cloud Mavis cron: <routine name> (cron #NN)`).
   Example: `[31-10] 12-cross-asset-correlation-snapshot`.
3. Set it with one call: `mcp_invoke` with tool_name `session_update` and arguments
   `{"session_id": "me", "title": "<the title>"}`. `me` means THIS conversation.
   If `mcp_invoke` reports that the tool is unknown, call `tool_search` with the query
   "session title update", then retry the same `mcp_invoke` call.
4. If the title cannot be set for any reason, carry on with the routine. This step must never
   block, delay, or fail the artifact.

## SCHEDULE
- Original local schedule: `37 7 * * 1-5` America/New_York — 07:37 ET weekdays
- Deployed schedule: `30 8 * * 1-5` America/New_York — 08:30 ET, Mon-Fri only.
  Moved from 07:37 ET on 2026-10-31 so the artifact lands after cron #19's 06:00 ET
  earnings reminder, which it reads.
- The day-of-week field is set in the SCHEDULER, so this routine does not fire at all on
  weekends: no agent invocation is spent discovering it is a weekend, and no weekend SKIPPED
  file is written. The WINDOW CHECK below keeps the one guard a cron expression cannot
  express — the market-holiday list.
- There is no pre-market session on a weekend and this brief has no weekend edition, so it does
  not run on Saturday or Sunday at all. (Retired 2026-10-31 — it used to fire daily and produce a
  scoped WEEKEND brief; see WEEKEND MODE below, kept for reference only and NOT to be used.)

## WINDOW CHECK (RUN FIRST, BEFORE FETCHING THE SKILL)

The scheduler owns the day-of-week and the hour, so this block exists for ONE reason: a cron
expression cannot express a **market holiday**, and the scheduler fires Mon-Fri *including* them.
On a holiday the market is closed and there is nothing to report.

```bash
# US MARKET HOLIDAYS — 2026 NYSE closures (non-weekend):
#   2026-01-01 2026-01-19 2026-02-16 2026-04-03 2026-05-25 2026-06-19 2026-07-03
#   2026-09-07 2026-11-26 2026-12-25
# Half-days (07:00 13:00 ET) are trading days and still report — do NOT skip them.
DATE=$(TZ=America/New_York date +%Y-%m-%d)
case "$DATE" in
    2026-01-01|2026-01-19|2026-02-16|2026-04-03|2026-05-25|2026-06-19|2026-07-03|2026-09-07|2026-11-26|2026-12-25)
        mkdir -p /workspace/$DATE
        cat > /workspace/$DATE/SKIPPED_agentic_pre_market_brief.md <<EOF
# Cron #26 agentic_pre_market_brief — SKIPPED
- Date (ET): $DATE
- Time (ET): $(TZ=America/New_York date +%H:%M)
- Reason: US market holiday ($DATE)
- No artifact produced.
EOF
        echo "out-of-window: US market holiday ($DATE)"
        echo "no artifact; no push"
        exit 0
        ;;
esac
echo "window-check: OK ($DATE)"
```

## SKILL SPEC (FETCH ONCE)
The skill's procedure body lives here:
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/skills/agentic-pre-market-brief/SKILL.md

**FIRST tool call:** `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/skills/agentic-pre-market-brief/SKILL.md` (or `web_fetch` if available). Read the procedure in full. Do NOT skip this step.
Then follow the procedure verbatim, with these Cloud adaptations below.

## MCP TOOLS AVAILABLE

The **MCP-over-HTTP bridge** (`_shared/mcp_bridge.py` — see PRIMARY SOURCE) is the market-data
source. Then `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `bash` (curl, python3), `connector__github__*` (repo
writes). **No `mcp__*` finance tool is registered in this runtime** — do not call one and do not
invent tool names.

## RUNTIME DATA-SOURCE CONTRACT (read before fetching any data)

**The `mcp__*` tools named above DO NOT EXIST in this runtime.** Do not attempt an MCP call and do
not wait for one to appear — a tool-not-found error converts into an early abort with no artifact.
Use instead: `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `bash` (curl, python3), and `connector__github__*` for repo
writes.

**Source ladder — try in this order, fall through on a real failure:**

1. bridge `market-recap` → `get_quotes` (batch quotes, `previous_close`, `change_pct`, `volume`,
   `as_of`, `market_state`). Not rate-limited. **This is the quote source of record.**
2. TradingView scanner `POST https://scanner.tradingview.com/america/scan` — movers, RVol,
   `premarket_volume`, `halted`, `market_cap_basic`.
3. Yahoo JSON — **availability varies by egress** (429 from one cron session, 200 from another on
   the same day). Try it; on 429/401 fall through. `quoteSummary`/`options` need the crumb.
4. Nasdaq API, SEC EDGAR (needs a contact-style User-Agent), CoinGecko, Frankfurter, Treasury CSV.

**A 429/403 is a RATE LIMIT, not a missing symbol.** Never report "no data" for a symbol you never
successfully queried. Retry once after a short sleep, then fall through.

**Sanity-check the RESPONSE BODY, not just the HTTP status.** Stooq returns 200 with a JavaScript
challenge, not CSV.

### Rules

1. **A 429/403 is a RATE LIMIT, not a missing symbol.** Never report "no data" for a
   symbol you never successfully queried. Retry once after a short sleep, then fall through the
   ladder.
2. **Sanity-check the RESPONSE BODY, not just the HTTP status.** The proxy can return HTTP 200
   carrying a plain-text error page. Confirm the body parses as the JSON/CSV you expect.
3. **Never fabricate a number.** If every source for a symbol failed, omit that symbol and say so.
   A missing row is recoverable; an invented price is not.
4. **Distinguish "no data" from "no source".** No print today (pre-market, weekend, holiday) is
   `no_data`. A symbol you could not fetch is `fetch_failed` — name the reason and HTTP status.
5. **Every artifact discloses per-source health**: a `## Source health` section **or** an equivalent
   `_source=` front-matter line — per source, the URL/query used, the HTTP status, and `ok` /
   `failed:<reason>`. If a source was rate-limited, say `429 rate-limited` and which fallback you
   used. Never hide a degraded run.
6. **Partial data beats no data.** If some symbols resolved and others did not, WRITE the artifact
   with the symbols you have, mark the gaps, and report `errors: <n>`. Do not abort the whole run
   because one source was blocked. The zero-fallback policy governs the *fallback chain*, not
   whether the artifact gets written.
7. **One number per field, one source per field.** When two sources give different
   values for the same field, pick ONE and say which in `## Source health`: the bridge's
   `market-recap` for prices and movers (it is Yahoo-sourced and not rate-limited), the TradingView
   scanner for pre-market and RVol, Yahoo JSON for history. When they disagree by more than 0.6 %,
   prefer the bridge, say so, and **do not publish both**. Never report "no source available" when
   a source is reachable — a 429 is a rate limit, not an absence.


## ZERO-FALLBACK POLICY
The skill procedure uses a fallback chain (PRIMARY → FALLBACK → skip).
**Every fallback MUST terminate with:**
  "accept the partial result, write the artifact, and STOP. Do NOT chain <deeper MCP>."
Do NOT loop on MCP errors. Do NOT retry indefinitely. Do NOT re-raise.

## HELPER SCRIPTS (PYTHON)
Local Mavis called Python helpers like `python screen.py emit-sql ...` to do file I/O, parsing, and atomic writes.
**On Cloud, do NOT call those helpers — they don't exist here.** Re-implement the helper's job inline using tool calls.

## AUDIT LOG
Local Mavis wrote an audit line to a Windows audit file after every run.
**On Cloud, skip audit log writes.** Audit is not needed here. If something goes wrong, the failure is in the chat reply and the (missing) artifact.

## OUTPUT
Write the artifact to:
  `/workspace/daily-briefs/{date}-pre-market.md`

The `{date}` placeholder is the fire's **scheduled** date in US/Eastern, `YYYY-MM-DD`. Resolve it
from the run's `scheduled_at_ms` (`cron_read view=runs` → `run.scheduled_at_ms`), not from `date`
at execution time. If they differ, this is a **delayed replay**: rebuild for the scheduled date,
do NOT write a SKIPPED marker, and say in the artifact that it is a reconstruction produced late.
A replay is normal, not an error.
(Literal text "{date}" in this template — replace it with the actual date.)

If the skill produces multiple outputs (e.g. .md + .csv, or per-region files), write all of them in the same `/workspace/daily-briefs/` subdirectory, with `{date}` as part of each filename.

## GIT PUSH (OPTIONAL)

```bash
B=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/_shared
for U in "$B/push_artifact.sh" "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/karizaco/maxhermes-migration@main/cloud-prompts/_shared/push_artifact.sh"; do
  [ -s /workspace/push_artifact.sh ] || curl -sL -o /workspace/push_artifact.sh "$U"
done
sh /workspace/push_artifact.sh --out daily-briefs --add daily-briefs/{date}-pre-market.md --branch main
sh /workspace/verify_delivery.sh --path daily-briefs/{date}-pre-market.md --branch main
```

**If the push script cannot be fetched**, use the inline fallback in
`cloud-prompts/_shared/push_artifact.sh` — but never `git add -A`, and never
`git push … | head -3` (that returns head's exit status and reports a rejected push as success).


## DELIVERY VERIFICATION (MANDATORY - do this after the push block)

```bash
B=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karizaco/maxhermes-migration/main/cloud-prompts/_shared
for U in "$B/push_artifact.sh" "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/karizaco/maxhermes-migration@main/cloud-prompts/_shared/push_artifact.sh"; do
  [ -s /workspace/push_artifact.sh ] || curl -sL -o /workspace/push_artifact.sh "$U"
done
sh /workspace/push_artifact.sh --out daily-briefs --add daily-briefs/{date}-pre-market.md --branch main
sh /workspace/verify_delivery.sh --path daily-briefs/{date}-pre-market.md --branch main
```

**If the push script cannot be fetched**, use the inline fallback in
`cloud-prompts/_shared/push_artifact.sh` — but never `git add -A`, and never
`git push … | head -3` (that returns head's exit status and reports a rejected push as success).


## DELIVERY
The final reply (the only thing delivered to the chat) MUST use this structure. There is **no
line cap** — cap by NAMES SHOWN (top ~8 per tier), not by lines. Long-form detail belongs in
the artifact file, not in the chat.

1. **Prose opener** — 2-4 sentences: the headline finding of the run, then the caveat that most
   changes how it should be read. Complete sentences; no label lists, no clipped fragments.
2. **`### Signal`** — tiered bullets, ONE ticker per line, each line a short clause naming the
   catalyst or setup (e.g. `- BA -10.8% — Q3 adj EPS -$0.34 vs -$0.21 est; 737 Max ramp pushed
   to H2-27`). Follow the skill's chat rules for tier order, flags and the audit line.
   Lead with the top movers and the count of names, and give the source and any lag.
   State how many further names are in the artifact file.
3. **`### Method & caveats`** — 2-4 bullets: source(s), lag, universe/screen size, and every
   degraded or blocked source. Name what could not be verified.
4. **`### Files`** — one line per file written, with its sandbox path.
5. **`### Push / errors`** — one line for push status (`push: ok (verified)` /
   `push: skipped (token unset)` / `push: FAILED (<reason>)`) and one line for
   `errors: <n>` — count of **SOURCE** failures that degraded the artifact.
   0 = clean run. The absent `mcp__*` tools are NOT an error and must not be
   counted.

Do not narrate tool calls. Tool call → result → write → push → reply.

## CRITICAL REMINDERS
1. Skill URL above MUST be fetched first. If the fetch fails, write a stub artifact with `_source=skill_fetch_failed` and reply with the failure. Do NOT improvise the procedure from memory.
2. Use ONLY the tools named in the RUNTIME DATA-SOURCE CONTRACT above (`web_search`, `web_fetch`, `bash`). Do NOT call the `mcp__*` tools — they are not
   registered in this runtime — and do not invent tool names.
3. The cron session is fresh each time — there is no shared state. Treat every artifact as ephemeral unless pushed.
4. **This routine runs on WEEKDAYS only** (`30 8 * * 1-5`). The scheduler never starts a weekend
   run, and there is no weekend brief to produce. If the window check skips (a US market
   holiday), exit cleanly with "out-of-window: <reason>" and write the SKIPPED file — on a
   holiday a skipped fire is correct behaviour, not a failure.
5. Every percentage in the brief must trace to a fetched value or a cited source. Do not invent numbers. Audit before rendering.
